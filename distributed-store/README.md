Project 5: Distributed Systems
==============================

# How to Run: 
run `./setup.sh` to install grpc and its dependencies - answer yes to any
prompts it gives.

to build your code run `make` from inside the build directory.

If you want to add new files, edit the CMakeLists.txt file to include your
new source files in any targets they are use by. Then `cd` into the build
directory and run `cmake ..` before running `make` again, to update the
makefile with your new files.

The clients are provided in the `clients` directory - running them will give
you instructions on how to use them.
